Xamarin Tesseract OCR binding for iOS
=====================================


About
-----

Xamarin-Tesseract-OCR-iOS is an Xamarin binding for [Tesseract OCR](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

This could not exist without [Alex Soto](https://github.com/dalexsoto), who has done all the hard work creating the binding project & static lib in response to [This Xamarin forum question](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/3673/help-adding-tesseract-as-a-ios-binding-project).

The binding itself is the Tesseract.iOS project. This repository also contains Tesseract.iOS-Sample project, to show the most basic usage of this library in an iOS application.

Please feel free to contribute/improve on this binding :).
